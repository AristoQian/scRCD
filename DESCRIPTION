Description: This package calculates the cell-specific rareness score which indicates how "far" the cell is from the majority cells.
    The rareness scores are calculated from a graphical model via spectral clustering-based optimization problem.
    This package provides function for calculating the rareness scores and 2D-visualizing the rare cells.
