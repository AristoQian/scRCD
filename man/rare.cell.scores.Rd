\usage{
rare.cell.scores(pc, anchor.frac, alpha, times)
}
\arguments{
\item{pc}{The top PCs selected from PCA or other dimension reduction methods,
the columns refer to features and rows refer to samples}

\item{anchor.frac}{The proportion of anchor cells with respect to all cells}

\item{alpha}{The percentage of quantile for the distance threshold for bipartite construction.
The distance threshold is chosen by the alpha-quantile of the Euclidean distances between cells.
The distance threshold is to control the bipartite distance between cells and anchor cells
such that only the edges of anchor cells with small distances will remain.
While constructing the bipartite and calculating the distance of each cell to anchor cells,
the anchor cells with the Euclidean distance (of PCs) from the cell lower than the threshold are selected and the bipartite distances
will be calculated by similar to k-NN graphs, the bipartite distance between the cell and the remaining anchor cells will be set to 0.}

\item{times}{The current times of repetition}
}
\value{
the rareness scores for all the cell samples, the high rareness score of a cell suggest
the "further" this cell is compared to majority cells and a high possibility of this cell to be rare
}
\description{
Sorting the cells by the rareness scores, which are calculated from a graphical model via this function.
First, the anchor cells are randomly selected uniformly from all cells.
The bipartite (between anchor cells and all the cells) is constructed.
Then the affinity matrix is calculated as the bipartite multiply its transpose.
Finally the rareness scores are computed from a spectrum-clustering based optimization problem.
